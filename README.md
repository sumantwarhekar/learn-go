# 🚀 Learning Go (Golang) - Course Code & Challenges

This repository contains the code written and challenges completed while working through the **"Learning Go"** course on **LinkedIn Learning**, taught by **David Gassner**.

Go (Golang) is a powerful and popular language, especially for command-line applications, web services, and cloud development. This repository serves as a hands-on portfolio of the fundamental concepts and practical applications covered in the course.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course provided a foundational understanding of Go programming. The development environment used was **GitHub Codespaces**, offering an instant, cloud-based setup.

### Key Topics Covered:

* **Fundamentals:** Variables, constants, data types, and type conversions.
* **Data Structures:** Using arrays, slices, maps, and grouping related values with **structs**.
* **Control Flow:** Implementing conditional logic (`if`, `switch`) and iteration (`for` loops).
* **Functions & Methods:** Defining and using functions and methods.
* **Error Handling:** Using Go's idiomatic error handling.
* **Concurrency:** Understanding and implementing concurrent operations using **goroutines** and channels.
* **I/O Operations:** Working with local files (reading and writing).
* **Networking:** Making HTTP requests and processing content from the web.
* **Data Serialization:** Working with structured data formats like **JSON**.

## ✨ Learning Objectives Achieved

The code in this repository demonstrates the following core skills:

* Implementing basic syntax, variables, constants, and types.
* Organizing data using structs, arrays, slices, and maps.
* Creating robust logic using conditionals and loops.
* Programming concurrent operations with goroutines.
* Performing practical tasks like file handling and making web requests.
* Parsing and manipulating data structured as JSON strings.
